# 🚀 CEG Fabless RISC-V Summer Internship 2025  
### 📡 Collaboration with Vyoma Systems & Shakti Processor Team – IIT Madras

## 🧠 Problem Statement  
C-Class core RTL implementation and simulation: Implement atleast two different branch predictors and evaluate using set of benchmarks given by Shakti team. Compare performance of existing gshare predictor and the new predictors. Extra credit: Tuning the predictors for higher accuracy/lower misprediction rate.

## 🎯 Objective  
To enhance branch prediction efficiency in the Shakti C-Class Bluespec Core by:

- ✅ Tuning the existing Bimodal predictor
- ✅ Designing and integrating a new Tournament predictor
- 📈 Evaluating these predictors using CoreMark benchmark results.

---

## 📅 Project Plan

### 1️⃣ Study the Basics
- Understand branch prediction concepts.
- Focus on the following algorithms:
  - Bimodal
  - GShare
  - Tournament
- Analyze existing correlating branch predictor algorithms.

---

### 2️⃣ Analyze Existing BSV Code
- Revamp bimodal_nc.bsv and bimodal_c.bsv.
- Understand integration with the pipeline:
  - Where predictions are made
  - Where updates happen
  - How mispredictions are flushed

---

### 3️⃣ Design and Implement Tournament Predictor
- Create new module: Tournament.bsv
  - Internally use tuned bimodal and existing GShare predictors
- Use PredictorSelect.bsv:
  - Implement a 2-bit selector table (saturating counter) to pick the better predictor dynamically
- Integrate into the C-Class core

---

### 4️⃣ Simulate and Benchmark
- Run basic RISC-V assembly tests
- Benchmark with CoreMark
- Analyze performance using:
  - Prediction accuracy
  - Misprediction rate
  - Instructions Per Cycle (IPC)
  - Total Cycle Count
